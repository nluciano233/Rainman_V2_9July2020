RAINMAN V2 uses card counting. For now the program is trying to get the 
player to score as many points as possible before busting.
It does it by predicting the probability of the next group of 
cards (low, neutral or high) and the card from the group that has 
the highest percentage to be picked.

It is not able yet to play against the house, since it can only decide
when to hit or when to stand.
